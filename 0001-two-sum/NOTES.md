This code is a solution to the Two Sum: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ problem on LeetCode. The problem states:

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

The code works by first creating a vector called ans to store the indices of the two numbers. The code then iterates over the nums vector, starting at index 0. For each iteration, the code iterates over the nums vector again, starting at index i + 1. If the sum of the current element and the element at index j is equal to the target, the code pushes the indices i and j to the ans vector.â€‹
