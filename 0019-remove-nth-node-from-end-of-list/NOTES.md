This code is a solution to the Remove Nth Node From End: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/ problem on LeetCode. The problem states:

Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list.

The code works by first initializing a prev pointer to NULL. The code then iterates over the linked list, starting at the head. For each iteration, the code updates the prev pointer to point to the current node.

When the code reaches the node that should be removed, the code removes the node by setting the next pointer of the previous node to the next node of the current node.

The code finally returns the head of the linked list.â€‹
