â€‹This code is a solution to the Number of Employees Who Met the Target: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-employees-who-met-the-target/ problem on LeetCode. The problem states:

Given an array of non-negative integers hours and a non-negative integer target, return the number of employees who have worked more than or equal to the target hours.

The code works by first declaring a variable called count to store the number of employees who met the target. The code then iterates over the hours array, starting at index 0. For each iteration, the code checks if the value at the current index is greater than or equal to the target. If it is, the code increments the count variable.

The code finally returns the value of the count variable.
